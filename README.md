# ProgressBarButton

This repo makes use of the following important concepts in Android.

1. Design a custom button from scratch (by extending directly from `View` and by drawing directly on `Canvas`). This button also shows 2 different type of progress animations: horizontal, circular. This view also has its own custom attributes.
2. Downloading a file with `URLConnection` and `Retrofit2` while showing its progress in parallel.
3. Using Android Notifications with action buttons.
4. Integration of notification actions with `Android Navigation Component`.
5. Using `Kotlin Flow` to publish updates.
6. Using `DataBinding` library.
